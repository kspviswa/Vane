# उत्तारम् — Direct Your Curiosity

उत्तारम् is a **privacy-focused AI answering engine** forked from [Vane](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Vane). It runs on your own hardware, combines web knowledge with local and cloud LLMs (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, and more), and delivers cited answers — all while keeping your data private.

## What Makes उत्तारम् Different?

This fork introduces several features not found in the upstream Vane project:

- **Memories** — Automatically extracts personal facts, preferences, and project info from your conversations. The LLM uses these to personalize answers across sessions. A health-check routine (dedup, merge, paraphrase, recategorize) keeps the memory store clean.
- **Projects** — Organize chats into named groups. Create, rename, and delete projects; move chats between them; start new chats directly inside a project.
- **Context length slider + token tracking** — See exactly how many tokens your conversation uses, set your model's context window, and get visual warnings as you approach the limit.
- **Post-answer actions** — Summarize long answers with one click, or fork a thread to continue a sub-topic without losing the original conversation.
- **Image upload with VLM analysis** — Upload images; a Vision Language Model describes them before the main LLM responds, so the model can answer questions about visual content.
- **Pipeline state tracking** — Real-time phase display during research (searching, extracting, writing, etc.) so you always know what the agent is doing.
- **Timeout + automatic retries** — Failed LLM calls and SearXNG requests get up to 3 retries with visible progress. No silent failures.
- **Settings as a dedicated page** — Full-page settings UI instead of a modal, with DB-backed persistence for all preferences (theme, location, name, model selection, etc.).
- **Math rendering & PDF export** — KaTeX-rendered math expressions in answers, with DOM-clone PDF export for sharing.
- **Smarter citations** — Copy answers to clipboard with citation HTML tags properly stripped.
- **iOS PWA support** — Installable as a standalone web app on iOS Safari.

## ✨ Features

⚡ **Smart search modes** — Speed, Balanced, or Quality mode depending on how deep you need to go.

🧭 **Pick your sources** — Search the web, discussions, or academic papers.

🧩 **Widgets** — Weather, calculations, stock prices, and other contextual UI cards.

🔍 **Web search powered by SearxNG** — Access multiple search engines privately.

📷 **Image and video search** — Visual content alongside text results.

📄 **File uploads** — Upload PDFs, text files, and images; ask questions about them.

🌐 **Domain-specific search** — Limit searches to specific websites.

💡 **Smart suggestions** — Search suggestions as you type.

📚 **Discover** — Browse trending articles throughout the day.

🕒 **Search history** — All searches saved locally in the library.

## Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 7777:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/home/vane/data \
  --name uttaram \
  kspviswa/uttaram:latest
```

Open http://localhost:7777 and configure your AI provider + SearXNG URL in the setup screen.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  uttaram:
    image: kspviswa/uttaram
    ports:
      - '7777:3000'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/home/vane/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kspviswa/Vane.git
cd Vane
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## Configuration

On first launch you'll enter the setup wizard:

1. Enter your name and location (used to personalize greetings and timezone-aware responses).
2. Add one or more AI providers (API keys, endpoints).
3. Select your default chat and embedding models.
4. Optionally configure a SearXNG URL for web search.

All settings persist in the database and can be changed later under **Settings**.

## Using as a Search Engine

Add a custom search engine in your browser pointing to:

```
http://localhost:7777/?q=%s
```

## Why Fork?

उत्तारम् started as a fork to address specific needs:

- **Persistent personalization** — The memories feature lets the LLM learn from past conversations, something the upstream didn't have.
- **Better organization** — Projects let you group related chats together.
- **Transparency** — Real-time pipeline state and token usage tracking give you visibility into what the agent is doing.
- **Resilience** — Timeouts and automatic retries prevent silent failures.
- **Everyday usability** — Image uploads, math rendering, PDF export, and citation fixes make it practical for daily use.
